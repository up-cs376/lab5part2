BUT, IN A LARGER SENSE, WE CAN NOT DEDICATE -- WE CAN NOT
CONSECRATE -- WE CAN NOT HALLOW -- THIS GROUND. THE BRAVE MEN,
LIVING AND DEAD, WHO STRUGGLED HERE, HAVE CONSECRATED IT, FAR
ABOVE OUR POOR POWER TO ADD OR DETRACT. THE WORLD WILL LITTLE
NOTE, NOR LONG REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY HERE, BUT IT CAN NEVER FORGET
WHAT THEY DID HERE. IT IS FOR US THE LIVING, RATHER, TO BE
DEDICATED HERE TO THE UNFINISHED WORK WHICH THEY WHO FOUGHT
HERE HAVE THUS FAR SO NOBLY ADVANCED. IT IS RATHER FOR US TO BE
HERE DEDICATED TO THE GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US -- THAT FROM
THESE HONORED DEAD WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE FOR
WHICH THEY GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION -- THAT WE HERE
HIGHLY RESOLVE THAT THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN --
THAT THIS NATION, UNDER GOD, SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM
-- AND THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE
PEOPLE, SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH.
