NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GREAT CIVIL WAR, TESTING WHETHER THAT
NATION, OR ANY NATION SO CONCEIVED AND SO DEDICATED, CAN LONG
ENDURE. WE ARE MET ON A GREAT BATTLE-FIELD OF THAT WAR. WE HAVE
COME TO DEDICATE A PORTION OF THAT FIELD, AS A FINAL RESTING PLACE
FOR THOSE WHO HERE GAVE THEIR LIVES THAT THAT NATION MIGHT LIVE.
IT IS ALTOGETHER FITTING AND PROPER THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS.
